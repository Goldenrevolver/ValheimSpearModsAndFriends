This mod makes thrown spears not get auto picked up by other players and they automatically return to you in a configurable amount of time.

It's a part of my spear mod collection

### Auto Pickup

To make spears multiplayer friendly, your thrown spear will no longer be automatically picked up by other players all the time. Anyone can still pick up a spear manually by interacting with it.

### Loyalty Return

Never worry about losing your fully upgraded spear again. A thrown spear returning into the players hand has been seen in games like Minecraft or in the mod Epic Loot already. In this mod, it's not intended to be an immediate return the second you hit (or miss) your enemy. Instead, it will return after a configurable amount of seconds and the default of 20 seconds is more so that you won't lose your spear if you can't find it again. But if you want you can always lower it down to one second to have a combat return (this config setting is server synced).

### Credits

The Auto Pickup restriction is inspired by the mod [HoldMySpear](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Kevver/HoldMySpear/) by Kevver. I didn't like the invasive permanent binding, so I opted for the approach of just preventing the auto pickup.

A part of the code is based on the 'Recall Weapon' effect from [Epic Loot](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/RandyKnapp/EpicLoot/) which has been taken with permission.

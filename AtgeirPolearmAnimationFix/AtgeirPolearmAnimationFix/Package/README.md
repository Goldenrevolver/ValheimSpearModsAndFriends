This mod fixes misalignments between hand and weapon position for atgeir/polearm animations.

It's a part of my spear mod collection
- [Proper Spears - Forward Facing With Thrust Attacks](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Goldenrevolver/Proper_Spears_Forward_Facing_With_Thrust_Attacks/)
- [Loyal Spears - Auto Pickup And Return To Owner](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Goldenrevolver/Loyal_Spears_Auto_Pickup_And_Return_To_Owner/)
- [Harpoon Melee Attack And Upgrading](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Goldenrevolver/Harpoon_Melee_Attack_And_Upgrading/)
- [Atgeir/Polearm Animation Fix](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Goldenrevolver/Atgeir_Polearm_Animation_Fix/)

The atgeir/polearm animations have quite a few animation flaws since release, but I found the one on the first attack of the primary attack chain the hardest to ignore, so I fixed it. I may fix a few more of them in the future if I use atgeirs more regularly. I hope this helps you focus more on the action and fun instead of the animation flaw!

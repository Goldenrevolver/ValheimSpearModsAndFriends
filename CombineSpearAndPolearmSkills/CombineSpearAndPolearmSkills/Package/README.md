This mod allows you to combine specific weapon skills like spears and polearms, knives and fists, bows and crossbows, retroactively and reversibly.

<details> <summary>History of the mod</summary> With the release of Mistlands, Iron Gate originally wanted to split even more of the established weapon classes like axes, swords and clubs into one handed and two handed versions. Fortunately, they listened to feedback and abandoned that apart from splitting off the crossbow skill from the bow skill, which at least makes a bit more sense balancing wise. But now is the time to go into the opposite direction... and then I didn't mod Valheim for 8 months.</details>

This mod allows you to 'combine' skills by making them gain experience together. The first time you load up any save with this mod installed, your characters total experience in both skills is calculated and then used to measure your new combined level as if they had never been split. After that, they simply stay synchronized.

This process is also even reversible, so if you disable a skill combination in the config, the original levels will be restored and the experience earned while combined will be evenly split between the two skills.

There are three options that can be enabled or disabled in the config:
- <details> <summary>Combining Spears and Polearms (default: enabled)</summary> Fellow lovers of long sticks that poke people, enjoyers of spears, atgeirs, halberds, glaives, partisans, pikes, war scythes and other polearms. Long have we suffered under the rule of the skills that have a one handed and two handed version. But this ends now!</details>
- <details> <summary>Combining Knives and either Fists or Swords (default: disabled)</summary> Fellow assassins, thiefs and other rogues; enjoyers of small and personal weapons like daggers, knifes, claws, knuckles or even your bare fists. Long have we suffered under the rule of the skills that don't punish you for trying to enjoy a bit of variety. But this ends now!</details>
- <details> <summary>Combining Bows and Crossbows (default: disabled)</summary>Fellow marksman, archers, crossbowmen and other rangers; enjoyers of shooting enemies from a safe distance with a deadly projectile. Long have we suff... okay, we are using one of the strongest weapon type in the game, but wanna be even stronger?</details>

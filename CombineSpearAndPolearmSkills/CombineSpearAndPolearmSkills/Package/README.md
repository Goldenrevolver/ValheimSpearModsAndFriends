This mod allows you to combine specific weapon skills like spears and atgeirs/polearms, bows and crossbows, or knives and fists, retroactively and reversibly.

<details> <summary>History of the mod</summary> With the release of Mistlands, Iron Gate originally wanted to split even more of the established weapon classes like axes, swords and clubs into one handed and two handed versions. Fortunately, they listened to feedback and abandoned that apart from splitting off the crossbow skill from the bow skill, which at least makes a bit more sense balancing wise. But now is the time to go into the opposite direction... and then I didn't mod Valheim for 8 months.</details>

This mod allows you to 'combine' skills by making them gain experience together. The first time you load up any save with this mod installed, your characters total experience in both skills is calculated and then used to measure your new combined level as if they had never been split. After that, they simply stay synchronized.

This process is also even reversible, so if you disable a skill combination in the config, the original levels will be restored and the experience earned while combined will be evenly split between the two skills.

There are three options that can be enabled or disabled in the config:
- Combining Spears and Atgeirs/Polearms (default: enabled)
- Combining Bows and Crossbows (default: disabled)
- Combining Knives and Fists (default: disabled)

Of course, this also works with skill buffs. For example, when combining the knife and fist skills, knives will be boosted by the fenris armor set bonus.

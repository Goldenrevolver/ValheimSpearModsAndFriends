This mod turns spears into the viable long range one handed melee weapons they should be.

It's a part of my spear mod collection
- [Proper Spears - Forward Facing With Thrust Attacks](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Goldenrevolver/Proper_Spears_Forward_Facing_With_Thrust_Attacks/)
- [Loyal Spears - Auto Pickup And Return To Owner](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Goldenrevolver/Loyal_Spears_Auto_Pickup_And_Return_To_Owner/)
- [Harpoon Melee Attack And Upgrading](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Goldenrevolver/Harpoon_Melee_Attack_And_Upgrading/)
- [Atgeir/Polearm Animation Fix](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Goldenrevolver/Atgeir_Polearm_Animation_Fix/)
- Combined Weapon Skills - Spears And Polearms (currently in testing)

Spears are now held the correct way around in their idle animation and are always ready to release a proper deadly thrust attack at chest level with the same range as an atgeir. And you can still throw them just like before!

If [Harpoon Melee Attack And Upgrading](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Goldenrevolver/Harpoon_Melee_Attack_And_Upgrading/) is installed, this will also apply to the abyssal harpoon.

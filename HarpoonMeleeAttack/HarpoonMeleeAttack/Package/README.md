This mod gives the harpoon the spear primary attack and moves the harpoon throw to the secondary attack. Additionally, it changes its stats and makes it upgradeable.

### Stats and Upgrading

The damage of the new primary attack is between the Bronze Spear and the Ancient Bark Spear. The amount of chitin required to craft the Abyssal Harpoon has been reduced from 30 to 20, and it can now be upgraded with 10/20/30 chitin, just like the Abyssal Razor. Lastly, its durability is higher and increases even more with upgrading.

### Primary Attack

The primary attack animation is now identical to all other spears, while the unique throw of the harpoon is now the secondary attack. If you hook something with the throw attack, the line will break when you use the primary attack.

If [Proper Spears - Forward Facing With Thrust Attacks](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Goldenrevolver/Proper_Spears_Forward_Facing_With_Thrust_Attacks/) is installed, the harpoon also receives its new long range primary thrusting attack and idle animation. It will temporarily revert to the old idle animation after using the harpoon throw until you attack again to not look weird while dragging something.
